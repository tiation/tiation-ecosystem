```

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
cd /Users/tiaastor/tiation-github/tiation-automation-workspace/TiationShell-iOS-Full
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using Swift Package Manager
swift package resolve

# Or open in Xcode and it will auto-resolve
open Package.swift
```

### 3. Configure Targets

In Xcode:

1. **Main App Target**:
   - Add "App Groups" capability
   - Add "Keychain Sharing" capability
   
2. **File Provider Extension Target**:
   - Create new target: File → New → Target → File Provider Extension
   - Name: "TiationShellFileProvider"
   - Add to same app group as main app

### 4. Configure Info.plist

Add to main app's Info.plist:
```xml
<key>NSFileProviderDomainUsageDescription</key>
<string>TiationShell needs to register file providers to access server files in the Files app</string>

<key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key>
<true/>

<key>LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace</key>
<true/>
```

### 5. Build and Run

```bash
# Command line
xcodebuild -scheme TiationShell -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro'

# Or in Xcode
# Select scheme and device, then Cmd+R
```

## 💡 Key Features Implementation

### SSH Connection
```swift
// Real SSH connection with SwiftSH
appState.connect(to: server)

// Execute commands
sshService.executeCommand("ls -la", on: connection)
    .sink { result in
        print(result)
    }
```

### Secure Storage
```swift
// Credentials stored securely in Keychain
try keychainService.saveServerCredentials(server)

// SSH keys managed securely
let keyPath = try keychainService.saveSSHKey(
    privateKey: privateKeyData,
    publicKey: publicKeyData,
    name: "my_key"
)
```

### File Transfers
```swift
// Download with progress
appState.downloadFile(from: "/remote/file.pdf", to: localURL)

// Upload with progress  
appState.uploadFile(from: localURL, to: "/remote/destination/")
```

### Files App Integration
- Servers appear as locations in Files app
- Browse remote directories natively
- Open files in any compatible app
- Save files directly to servers

## 🔧 Configuration

### SSH Keys
Store in app's Documents directory:
```
~/Documents/TiationShell/ssh_keys/
```

### File Provider Domains
Automatically registered for each server. Access in Files app under:
```
Browse → Locations → [Server Name]
```

## 📱 Usage Examples

### Adding a Server with SSH Key
```swift
let server = Server(
    name: "Production",
    host: "prod.example.com",
    username: "deploy",
    authMethod: .publicKey(path: keyPath)
)
appState.addServer(server)
```

### Mounting in Files App
1. Open Files app
2. Tap "Browse"
3. Under Locations, find your server
4. Tap to browse files
5. Long-press files for options

### Batch Operations
```swift
// Download multiple files
for file in selectedFiles {
    appState.downloadFile(
        from: file.path,
        to: documentsURL.appendingPathComponent(file.name)
    )
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **End-to-end encryption** for all SSH connections
- **Keychain protection** for all credentials
- **Biometric authentication** support for accessing saved credentials
- **No third-party servers** - direct connection only
- **Secure file storage** with iOS data protection

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
swift test
```

### Integration Tests
Tests included for:
- SSH connections
- File transfers
- Keychain operations
- File Provider functionality
